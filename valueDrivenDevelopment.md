# Value Driven Development

## In 10 years, will we be proud about what we're building?

As a community, we love to talk about **tooling**, but not about _real problems_. We need to take accountability for our code. We are responsible when we ship dark patterns and exploitative features — but we can use our position of power to change that.

## Moving towards Value Driven Development

Software can be used as a tool to reduce human suffering. When analyzing your time and effort, think about these things:

- Who is this helping?
- What does this software bring to the table of humanity?

We can use this framework for moving towards value driven development:

#### Who are you working for?

I'm not working for my employer, I'm working for my **user**. Data points **are people**

#### Choose your next job wisely

Stay away from companies employing dark UX patterns. Do your research and ask the _hard_ questions during the interview, for example, how do you practice inclusivity?

#### Consider donating time for worthy causes

List of examples:

- [Too Good To Go](https://toogoodtogo.com/en) — Connecting restaurants with expiring food to hungry families
- [Be My Eyes](https://www.bemyeyes.com) — Empowering visually impaired people through video calls
- [Red Cross](https://github.comifrcgo/cbs) — Community-based surveillance for alerting of possible outbreaks
- [distribue|AID](https://distributeaid.org) — A Europe-wide network that connects reguee aid groups, allowing costs to be lowered for aid shipments.

It takes a **value driven community** to build **valuable tech**. The future of JavaScript is driven by its community, so let's get our values right first.
