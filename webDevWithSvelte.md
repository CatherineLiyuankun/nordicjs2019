## What is Svelte?

## Takeaways

Svelte compiles down to a **much smaller** bundle size than most popular frameworks. A Svelte application is typically **1/20** the size of the same application written in React+Redux.

State management is baked in and much easier to implement.

Reactive expressions make re-calculating and re-rendering really simple.
